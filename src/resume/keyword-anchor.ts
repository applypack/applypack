 * Persist-time verbatim guard (target-plan.md §4 F2). The prompt wants every
 * keyword copied character-for-character from the posting because the panes
 * highlight by literal search; when the model paraphrases anyway, the row
 * sits in the table and highlights nowhere. This pass runs the matcher over
 * the posting: a keyword with no span is re-anchored to the longest verbatim
 * phrase of itself (two or more of its words in a row) the posting does
 * contain — the term becomes that phrase, spelled as the posting spells it —
 * and one with none is marked `unanchored`, so the UI can say so and the log
 * can count it: the regression metric for every PROMPT_VERSION bump. Pure —
 * the matcher comes in as an argument.
